## Overview

The **Kintex-7 MIPI DSI 3.5-inch LCD** project allows you to control a TFT display using the MIPI DSI protocol. The Kintex-7 FPGA provides the necessary processing power and flexibility for various display applications. This repository includes HDL code written in Verilog, test benches, and example projects to help you get started quickly.

## Features

- **MIPI DSI Interface**: Supports high-speed data transmission to the LCD.
- **FPGA Compatibility**: Designed specifically for the Xilinx Kintex-7 series.
- **TFT Display Support**: Full control of 3.5-inch TFT LCD screens.
- **Open-source**: All code is available for modification and enhancement.
- **Documentation**: Detailed instructions for setup and usage.

## Hardware Requirements

To use this project, you will need the following hardware:

- **Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA Board**: Ensure that your board supports MIPI DSI.
- **3.5-inch MIPI DSI LCD**: Make sure it is compatible with the Kintex-7.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure your setup has a stable power source.
- **Cables**: Necessary connections for the LCD and FPGA board.

## Software Requirements

You will need the following software to work with this project:

- **Xilinx Vivado**: This project is developed using Vivado. Make sure to have the latest version installed.
- **Verilog Support**: Ensure your Vivado installation includes Verilog support.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apaontop/Kintex-7-MIPI-DSI-3.5-inch-LCD.git
   ```

2. **Open Vivado**: Launch the Vivado IDE.

3. **Create a New Project**: Start a new project in Vivado and add the source files from the cloned repository.

4. **Configure the Project**: Set the appropriate settings for your FPGA board.
